Build embedding database:

Example - writes PDB file embeddings and meta data to files with pathname root "dompdb" using CUDA device 0 (default is CPU):

pytorch_foldclass_makedb.py -d cuda:0 -o dbdir/dompdb /data/cath/dompdb/*.pdb

Note that the pathname for the DB files can be included, but the absolute pathnames of the PDB files are stored in the DB, so
source PDB files needs to be in the same place on cluster nodes.


Searching:

Note: Assumes tmalign is in current PATH.

Run search of DB with 4 threads, top-20 closest embeddings evaluated for tmalign alignment. Note that the tmalign step
ends early if conditions are already met i.e. match with TM-score > 0.5 (default) and target coverage > 0.7 (default)

pytorch_foldclass_dbsearch.py -t 4 -k 20 -n dbdir/dompdb -t 4 target1.pdb target2.pdb target3.pdb > output.txt
